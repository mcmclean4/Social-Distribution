# Distributed Social Networking
Social Distribution is a decentralized social network platform inspired by ActivityPub and Diaspora, designed to enable peer-to-peer content sharing across nodes. Users can follow others across the network, view aggregated posts in their inbox-style feed, and interact via likes and commentsâ€”all without relying on a central server.
